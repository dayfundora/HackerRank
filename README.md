This repository contains solutions to my interview's problems on [HackerRank](www.hackerranck.com), with Python 3.

### Alphabet Filter
Given a string, remove the vowels (consonants) from the string and print the string without vowels (consonants).

### Featured Product
An e-commerce site tracks the purchases made each day. The product that is purchased the most one day is the featured product for the following day. If there is a tie for the product purchased most frequently, those product names are ordered alphabetically ascending and the last name in the list is chosen.

### Prime Or Not
Given a number, return the smallest divisor, if it's prime return 1.
