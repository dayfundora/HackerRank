This repository contains solutions to my interview's problems on [HackerRank](www.hackerranck.com), with Python 3.

### Alphabet Filter
Given a string, remove the vowels (consonants) from the string and print the string without vowels (consonants).

### BinaryTree Search

### Featured Product
An e-commerce site tracks the purchases made each day. The product that is purchased the most one day is the featured product for the following day. If there is a tie for the product purchased most frequently, those product names are ordered alphabetically ascending and the last name in the list is chosen.

### Maximize the Final Element
Given an array `arr[]` consisting of `N` integers, rearrange the array such that it satisfies the following conditions:

* `arr[0]` must be `1`.
* Difference between adjacent array elements should not exceed `1`, that is, `arr[i] – arr[i-1] ≤ 1` for all `1 ≤ i < N`.
* The permissible operations are as follows:
	* Rearrange the elements in any way.
	* Reduce any element to any number ≥ `1`.
	* The task is to find the maximum possible value that can be placed at the last index of the array.

### Last and Second
Takes the last two letters from an input and print an output that shows just the last two letters but reversed with a space in the middle.

### Ones Groups

### Prime Or Not
Given a number, return the smallest divisor, if it's prime return 1.

### Aladdin and His Carpet
